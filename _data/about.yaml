# about me
first-paragraph: My name is Harry Nicol√°s Guajan Simbana, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at the <a href="https://www.epn.edu.ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Polytechnic School of Ecuador (EPN)</a>. This program has provided me with strong foundations in programming, database systems, and development tools while motivating me to explore emerging fields in computing. I remain committed to continuous learning, striving to enhance both my technical skills and problem-solving capabilities.
second-paragraph: I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quito" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quito, Ecuador</a>, a city that has offered me exceptional opportunities for personal and academic growth. Since childhood, I've demonstrated keen interest in technology and creative disciplines, which I now channel into projects combining logical structure, thoughtful design, and practical functionality. I strongly believe in maintaining balance between technical excellence and human-centered approaches when developing accessible solutions.
research-introduction: Currently in my fourth semester, I'm particularly focused on software and application development, working extensively with <code>Java</code> and <code>Python</code>.

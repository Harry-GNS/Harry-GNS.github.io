introduction: About Me

about-me:
  first-paragraph: I'm a Computer Engineering student—an organized person committed to my professional growth. Although I'm still in training, I work every day to improve both my technical and personal skills.
  second-paragraph: I've discovered that programming goes far beyond writing lines of code; it's a powerful tool for creating solutions that can positively impact people's lives. That's what truly inspires me to keep learning.
  free-time: 
    - "Losing myself in the pages of poetry books or magical realism, especially works by Neruda or García Márquez."
    - "Playing soccer with friends whenever I get the chance. I play as a goalkeeper—I'm not a professional, but I genuinely enjoy it."
    - "Sketching in my notebooks more for pleasure than technique, particularly when I need to unwind."
  quote: "To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life."
  closing-paragraph: I'm always open to connecting with others who are passionate about technology and continuous learning.

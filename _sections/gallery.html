        <p>I'm a Computer Engineering student—an organized person committed to my professional growth. Although I'm still in training, I work every day to improve both my technical and personal skills.</p>
        
        <p>I've discovered that programming goes far beyond writing lines of code; it's a powerful tool for creating solutions that can positively impact people's lives. That's what truly inspires me to keep learning.</p>
        
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy getting lost in the pages of poetry or magical realism, especially the works of Neruda or García Márquez. I also love playing soccer with friends whenever I get the chance. I play as a goalkeeper—I'm not a professional, but I genuinely enjoy it. Sketching is another one of my hobbies; I do it more for pleasure than for technique, especially when I need to unwind.</p>
        
        <p><i>A quote that has always inspired me is:</i></p>
        <blockquote>
            <i>"To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life."</i>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>I'm always open to connecting with others who are passionate about technology and continuous learning.</p>
